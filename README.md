This branch contains files of my website, generated by MKDocs, and associated tests written in Cypress.

I used XAMPP to host the files locally.

To run the website and the tests:
- install XAMPP
- copy content of `website` directory to `htdocs` directory inside XAMPP main directory
- start XAMPP, e.g. by sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start if you are using Linux, or by using GUI launcher if you are using Windows
- navigate to `cypress` directory and run `npx cypress open`
