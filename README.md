The purpose of this repository is to collect Cypress projects.

Each branch of this repository corresponds to one project and contains tests and files of the project being tested.

The repository currently contains the following branches:
- [old-website branch](https://github.com/VedVid/cypress-learning/tree/old-website) â€“ this branch contains my website which is static site generated by MKDocs; name `old-website` might be misleading right now as the same version of the website is available live, but I'm currently working on redesign
