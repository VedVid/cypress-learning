Roguelikes are my all-time favorite, and I participated in many editions of 7 Day Roguelike Challenge game jam. Below, I will present all games I created since 2013. Rogue Robs Trains stable game jam 7drl Rogue Robs Trains is a fast-paced roguelike created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2019. A player is a bandit that boarded the train to get his hands on gold filled chests! I wanted to catch the spaghetti western atmosphere and provide satisfying ranged combat mechanics. It is the first game created with RAWIG , and I hope not the last one - it worked very well and sped up the development process significantly. I had to adapt the framework for different needs, but most of the changes made specifically for Rogue Robs Trains have been implemented into RAWIG later. Unnamed Broughlike alpha It is my most recent game project. I was reading about broughlikes recently. It is a very specific genre, related to roguelikes. Everything started with Michael Brough . Linked Wikipedia article provides a rough overview of the design goals of broughlikes. Unfortunately, I do not have access to iOS devices, but I read a lot about Brough's games. I like their premise: small scale, streamlined gameplay, yet every run is full of meaningful decisions. My take on broughlikes is still in an early stage of development, but I had already a lot of fun with designing basic mechanics. I want to make resources management the core of the game, yet keep it simple. Player - pilot of a mecha - can shoot foes from afar, but every enemy is vulnerable to only one type of damage. Launchers' magazines are short, therefore the player needs to replenish ammunition often. The catch? Every drained resource should raise risk level , for example by spawning new enemy. Tiny Gatherer stable A small game about gathering trinkets on procedurally generated maps. Tiny Gatherer was my first game written in Go. The initial release was made in 24 hours, as a personal challenge. HumFallRL stable stalled game jam 7drl It was my first big project. It started as simple dungeon crawler... and last stable release remains spiritually the same. If you are interested, you may download never finished v12 , with debug mode enabled. It adds post-apocalyptic overworld with towns and settlements filled with NPCs, a few quests to complete (some mutually exclusive!), and many more improvements. Development stalled, mostly due to the huge scope gap between versions. Originally, I created HumFallRL for the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2013. Fragility alpha game jam 7drl Barebones 1HP roguelike. Made for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2014. NoirRL defunct game jam 7drl An adventure game in roguelike aesthetics. An obscure detective story, broken riddles, and travel through the United States. Made for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2015. After a few years, I am still pleased with the art style. Rogue With Purple Heart defunct game jam 7drl Roguelike shooter created for 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2016. The player is a lost soldier that needs to break through the jungle to find the evacuation site. Inspired by Platoon by Dale A. Dye. Fun fact: I made a special font just for this game. (Not so) colorful warrior alpha game jam 7drl Initially planned as 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2018 entry, I did not manage to finish the game before jam's deadline. Small puzzle roguelike, with a slightly obfuscated set of rules. Fleeing the fire stable game jam Simplistic endless runner in roguelike aesthetics. Optical Jam #3 entry. UnPabloQuest stable fork A fork of Cebollinos' PabloQuest 1.2 . UPQ rebalances early game and allows to customize graphics.","title":"Games"},{"location":"games/#games","text":"Since my childhood, games have been my passion.
